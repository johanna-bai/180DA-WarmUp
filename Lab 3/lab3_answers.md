## Task 1
See `rps_mqtt.png` and `rps_gui_mqtt.png` for screenshots of me playing the command-line game and the PyGame game with my teammate Nancy Zhao. 

## Task 2
The PyQT library seems to be event based when handling interactions. Using this in our project could be advantageous over using PyGames, since we won't need to worrry about logic and infinite loop issues that I encountered a few times when using PyGames to complete this lab. 

## Task 3
I think we would have relatively simple graphics for our project. We would mainly use graphics to show the general state of the game instead of mirroring what is happening physically in real time. For example, when our chaser is moving in our tag game, our graphics would simply say "chaser is moving" instead of trying show how the chaser is moving in real time.
